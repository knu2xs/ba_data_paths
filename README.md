# BA Data Paths

The data installed with Esri Business Analyst Desktop is a treasure trove for doing robust analysis. However, accessing this data though the Python environment is next to impossible. For my own convenience I have created this package to streamline when I need to access this data in my own projects and daily work. Please feel free to use it if it benefits your workflows as well.
